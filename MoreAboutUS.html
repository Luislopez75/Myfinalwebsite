        There is no one that can do it better than us. Instead of our robots performing a show, Luis’ Robots 
        makes sure to bring your guests to the dancefloor and dance with them. Your guests will be able to dance 
        with our amazing robots. At the end of every show Luis’ Robot show and staff will make it possible for you 
        and your guests to take pictures
